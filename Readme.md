# OverView of the Project

## This is a Convolutional Neural Network Project, where we classify the images based on three labels (Pizza, Steak and Sushi)
## The CNN architecture is inspired from **Tiny VGG**

## The Training and Testing Datasets have total **225** and **75** DataPoints and each further divided on **BATCH_SIZE** of **32** 
## Implemented Augmented Learning for the Training DataSet
## Trained the model on **50 Epochs**

## Inspired from the **ZerotoMastery** Udemy Course
